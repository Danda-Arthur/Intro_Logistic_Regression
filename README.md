# Intro_Logistic_Regression
Used when we have to choose between 2 values in this case choosing between malignant and benign. The regression produces an S shape graph.
Assumptions of logistic regression:         - There should not be any multi_collinearity in the model, which means the independent variables must be independent of each other.
                                            - We must include meaningful varibles in our model         
                                            - We should choose a lage sample size for our logisitic regression
